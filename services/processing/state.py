"""
This abstracts the "processing state" for a commit.

It takes care that each upload for a specific commit is going through the following
states:

- "processing": when an upload was received and is being parsed/processed.
- "processed": the upload has been processed and an "intermediate report" has been stored,
  the upload is now waiting to be merged into the "master report".
- "merged": the upload was fully merged into the "master report".

The logic in this file also makes sure that processing and merging happens in an "optimal" way
meaning that:

- "postprocessing", which means triggering notifications and other followup work
  only happens once for a commit.
- merging should happen in batches, as that involves loading a bunch of "intermediate report"s
  into memory, which should be bounded.
- (ideally in the future) an upload that has been processed into an "intermediate report"
  should be merged directly into the "master report" without doing a storage roundtrip for that
  "intermediate report".

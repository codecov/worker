        Fetches what the current yaml is supposed to be

        This function wraps the whole logic of fetching the current yaml for a given commit
            - It makes best effort in trying to fetch and parse the data from the repo
            - It merges it with the owner YAML and with the default system YAML as needed
            - It handles possible exceptions that come from fetching data from the repository

    Args:
        commit (Commit): The commit we want to get the provider from
        repository_service : The service (as fetched from get_repo_provider_service) that we can use
            to fetch the YAML data. If None, we just pretend the YAML data isn't fetchable

        dict: The yaml, parsed, processed and ready to use as the final yaml

        This is the task that syncs pull with the information the Git Provider gives us

    The most characteristic piece of this task is that it centers around the PR.
        We receive a (repoid, pullid) pair. And we fetch all the information
            from the git provider to update it as needed.

        This mostly includes
            - Updating basic database fields around the PR, like author
            - Updating `base` and `head` of the PR
            - Updating the `diff` and `flare` information of the PR using the `report` of its head
            - Updating all the commits that point to this pull in case the pull is being merged
            - Clear the caches we have around this PR

        At the end we call the notify task to do notifications with the new information we have

            The logic here is that, if at least one commit of the PR made it into the base branch,

                because it's possible that the base branch moves so fast that by the time
